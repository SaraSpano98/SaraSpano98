âš¡ My study path within the world of coding began in 2025. My intent was to reinvent myself both professionally and personally. 

The world of Web Developer had already fascinated me for a few years, but I didn't know how to get into it, until I came across a fantastic opportunity. Having a passion for art and drawing, I wanted to look more into the digital world.. and here I am! This is my beginning. 

Creating things from scratch is something I've always loved to do and putting personality into it is that touch that pushes everything to transform it towards a more interesting and curious eye. This is me. âœ¨

ðŸŒ± I love movies, reading articles or sites to learn new things (code, art and much more), games, books, drawing, painting, organizing.
